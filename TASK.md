# Firstleaf Take Home Project

## Intro
Today, we're going to construct a country of the world app!  This assignment allows you to demonstrate your experience with ReactJS and CSS.

## Assignment
Given a data API located here: https://restcountries.eu/#api-endpoints-all.  Build an app in ReactJS that meets the requirements below.

## Requirements
- displays a list of the countries using a component CountryCard for display
- allows you to click the country card, and display the countries' profile ("region, capital city and population (and any other extra info you'd like to add)")
- allows you to search for a specific country by name

Use: https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/name/{name}  ({name being the country name}) for searching the name
Use: https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all to get all the countries

## Extra
- What does code quality look like to you? Show us with your code!  If you have an eye for design, impress us with your CSS powers!

## Let's Get Started:
1. Clone this repository 
2. If you don't have node installed download it here: https://nodejs.org/en/
3. Go to the root directory of the repository in your command line and run npm i or npm install
4. Run npm start, and it should load a basic rendered page in your default browser
5. You're ready to code!
